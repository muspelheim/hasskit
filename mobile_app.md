First, we need to edit ***configuration.yaml*** by adding the following line:

Allow Home Assistant write file into www folder:

```
homeassistant:
  whitelist_external_dirs:
    - /config/www
```

Add notify.ALL_DEVICES service:
(Replace mobile_app_hasskit_mobile_app_1 with your registered device name)

```
notify:
  - name: ALL_DEVICES
    platform: group
    services:
      - service: mobile_app_hasskit_mobile_app_1
      - service: mobile_app_hasskit_mobile_app_2
      - service: mobile_app_hasskit_mobile_app_3      
```
<br>
<br>
Send a simple notification when the light turned on

```
automation:
  - alias: Notification Light Turned On
    trigger:
      - entity_id: light.light_1
        platform: state
        to: "on
    action:
      - service: notify.ALL_DEVICES
        data:
          title: Simple Notification 
          message: Light Turned On
```
<br>
<br>

```

  - alias: 'Notify when garage door opened'
    trigger:
    - entity_id: cover.garage_door
      platform: state
      to: "open"
    action:
    - data_template:
        entity_id: camera.camera_1
        filename: /config/www/camera_1.jpg
      service: camera.snapshot
    - delay:
        seconds: 1

## 6. Troubleshooting

```

## 7. iPhone Location Tracking, Always Allow
By default, iOS will only allow HassKit to track your location `While Using the App`. If you want you can allow HassKit to be able to update your location always.

1. Open iOS `Settings`.
2. Go into: `Privacy` > `Location Services`.
3. Find `HassKit` in the list and click it.
4. Change `Allow Location Access` to `Always`.
